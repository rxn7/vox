# TODO
- Proper player velocity
- Proper player physics (dont simply apply velocity, check if each block inbetween this and next position is not solid)
- Procedural world generation
- Frustum culling
- Greedy meshing far away chunks
- Infinite world
- Text renderer alignment
- Maybe use Sparse Voxel Octrees
